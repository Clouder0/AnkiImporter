as a question can only contain one line.

Table is now supported too.
| Syntax      | Description | Test Text     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| Header      | Title       | Here's this   |
| Paragraph   | Text        | And more      |
A funny feature.

- List Cloze
  - Cloze **as** a list
  - no need to contain a cloze in the first line
      - pretty **handy**
      - but remember this may make a card huge!

| Table      | Cloze | is also supported |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| H**e**ader      | Title       | Here's this   |
| Parag**ra**ph   | Text        | And more      |
