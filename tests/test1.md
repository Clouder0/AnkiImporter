# Cloze Example

This is a **multiple-line** cloze.  
Let's see what **will** happen.

It is notable that if the first line doesn't contain a cloze, then it would be recognized as a Q&A.  
Just like **this** one.

A single line **cloze**.

Cloze **[2]Numbering** is now **supported**, you can set whatever you want **[1]in text** directly.  
That's a **[2]handy** feature sometimes.

**[2] 2** and **1** and **[4] 4** and **[1] 1 again** and **2** and **[1] 1 again** and **3** and **[2] 2 again**
